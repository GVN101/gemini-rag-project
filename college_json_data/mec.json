MACS was conceived with a vision to inculcate aptitude for the subject among students and create an awareness about the intricacies of the field. It aims to educate the students on the advancements in the industry and learn concepts that aren't part of the curriculum. MACS facilitates the participation of students in inter-college events and initiates similar events in the college. The association is presently involved in a couple of projects and activities that are associated with the day to day functioning of the college. It maintains the web, mail and DNS servers in the college, along with the official website. The 'Linux Week' is conducted every year by MACS to get the students and the public introduced and familiarized with the operating system. Foss meet @ MEC, the Free and Open Source Software meet was conducted for the first time at the college campus as part of the annual Tech fest of Model Engineering College - Excel 2k9. The meet is an event that brings together FOSS enthusiasts from all over to share their ideas and help promote the FOSS movement.",

            "Description of MEC Solar Project": "Govt. Model Engineering College has made news repeatedly in the last near-thirty years of its magnificent existence. The college has always been at the forefront of innovation, cultural and community oriented activities, while continuing to be an indomitable force with regard to academic results, placement stats and advocacy of social causes. The project was initially conceived as a 100kW solar power plant to meet all the needs of the college but received approval for a 30kW power plant on technical grounds. The installation a 30kW solar panel would reduce the contract demand by about 50kVA. With the solar power generating station expected to generate 40,000 units per annum, reduction in contract demand and savings in power consumption would mean an annual saving of Rs. 0.4 million for the college. The 30kw on-grid solar plant has been constructed on 300 square metres of the total area of the rooftop of the main building. Hundred panels of 300W have been installed. Two on-grid inverters of 15kW installed as a part of the plant help in sending electricity generated directly to the grid instead of storing it in batteries. On working days, the solar power plant can partly take care of the electricity needs of the college, with the rest being supplied by the electricity board. During holidays, the plant exports the power to the grid. The main idea of the project was to cut down on costs and solve the energy crisis. And the toil and labour have borne fruit. Where the electricity bills previously rounded up to Rs 1.8lakhs, it now reduced by around Rs. 30,000. In the long run, the college expects to become self reliant for its energy needs."
