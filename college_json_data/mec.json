    "Project 1 Description of electrical and electronics department": "Govt. Model Engineering College has made news repeatedly in the last near-thirty years of its magnificent existence. The college has always been at the forefront of innovation, cultural and community oriented activities, while continuing to be an indomitable force with regard to academic results, placement stats and advocacy of social causes. The project was initially conceived as a 100kW solar power plant to meet all the needs of the college but received approval for a 30kW power plant on technical grounds. The installation a 30kW solar panel would reduce the contract demand by about 50kVA. With the solar power generating station expected to generate 40,000 units per annum, reduction in contract demand and savings in power consumption would mean an annual saving of Rs. 0.4 million for the college. The 30kw on-grid solar plant has been constructed on 300 square metres of the total area of the rooftop of the main building. Hundred panels of 300W have been installed. Two on-grid inverters of 15kW installed as a part of the plant help in sending electricity generated directly to the grid instead of storing it in batteries. On working days, the solar power plant can partly take care of the electricity needs of the college, with the rest being supplied by the electricity board. During holidays, the plant exports the power to the grid. The main idea of the project was to cut down on costs and solve the energy crisis. And the toil and labour have borne fruit. Where the electricity bills previously rounded up to Rs 1.8lakhs, it now reduced by around Rs. 30,000. In the long run, the college expects to become self reliant for its energy needs.",
