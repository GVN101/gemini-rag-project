In response to the Kothari Commission's proposal that education be oriented to the social needs by involving students in community service, the NSS has been implemented in colleges and universities throughout India. There is a dedicated N.S.S. wing at College of Applied Science Adoor. There are 110 volunteers in total between our two National Service Scheme units. After completing the required training, volunteers receive credentials from the university. This certification adds value to further education and serves as a prerequisite for employment in the public sector.",
