The faculty of the department have got rich experience in Thermal Engineering, Computational Combustion, CFD,- Aerospace Engineering, - Cryogenics, Robotics etc. The instructional laboratories with latest computational facilities will be provided for practical exposure and study all the areas of mechanical engineering.",
                    "-- The students are exposed to problems faced by our society, will be engaged in outreach programmes and industry institute interactions, will be encouraged to participate in co-curricular activities and professional development activities beyond the regular academic work. As per the new curriculum, students can get Honours degree. They can also get a Minor degree in other most wanted areas such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics etc along with the regular BTech degree or Honours degree based on their interest. Department gives individual attention to each student and helps the student to mould himself/herself based on the talent and interest. Remedial measures are also taken for the needy students.",
